# Classifying Autism Spectrum Disorder Using Machine Learning through ABIDE Dataset

## Abstract:
A neurodevelopmental disorder named autism spectrum disorder (ASD) is challenging to diagnose. The prevailing diagnostic manner is based merely on the behavioral measurement with a high tendency of misdiagnosis. People require an advanced method to make more quantitative diagnosis. 

## Code discription:
Two deep learning architectures were explored with the machine learning methods. The Mixup method was used to augment the original functional Magnetic Resonance Imaging data. Features of the data extracted by two different kinds of autoencoders which are Sparse Autoencoder and Variational Autoencoder were used as inputs of two deep neural networks functioning as classifiers respectively. \

The models can classify patients with ASD from typical control subjects with the accuracy of 75.5%(SAE) and 75.2%(VAE) respectively, which outperformed the other state-of-the-art method by 4.7% and 4.4%. The further significance of this project is to help devel-op our perception of the neurobiological foundation of the ASD.
